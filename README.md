# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise


In this project, I worked with `receipt.json`, `brands.json`, and `users.json` to create a relational ER Diagram, which can be viewed through the ER Diagram `FetchErDiagram.pdf`. In the notebook, I loaded the data, transformed the JSON-format into a data frame, and captured data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicate values, and DateTime data. I also query questions that I want to share with the business stakeholder. Last, I draft a communication email to help them understand my progress and update the work.
